# PREP: Planning Routes for Emergency Preparedness

## Project Overview

PREP (Planning Routes for Emergency Preparedness) is an AI and IoT-based evacuation planning and simulation system. It dynamically recalculates safe escape routes in real-time using adaptive pathfinding algorithms, live hazard detection, and crowd behavior modeling. With a visual dashboard and real-world integration potential, PREP helps authorities and citizens respond more effectively during emergencies.
